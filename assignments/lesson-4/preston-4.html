            <h5>Editorial Article</h5>
            <p>Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are
                mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but
                through its Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame
                these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the
                Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell
                of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through
                the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true
                salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will
                teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The
                Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.</p>
